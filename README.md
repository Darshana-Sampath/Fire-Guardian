# Fire Guardian – LabVIEW-based Fire Detection System
Overview

Fire Guardian is a LabVIEW-based project designed to detect fire hazards and trigger early warnings.
The system uses sensor inputs (like temperature, smoke, or flame sensors) and processes the data in real-time to issue alerts, helping to prevent major fire incidents.

This project was originally developed for academic purposes and is shared here for learning, reference, and inspiration.

Features

🔥 Real-time fire detection using multiple sensor inputs

🚨 Immediate alarm activation upon detecting fire conditions

📊 User-friendly LabVIEW interface for monitoring sensor readings

🛡️ Simple, reliable, and customizable design for small-scale deployments

Technologies Used

  1. LabVIEW – Graphical programming environment

  2. NI DAQ (optional) – For sensor data acquisition

  3. Temperature, Smoke, and/or Flame Sensors – For fire detection

  4. Alarm system (e.g., buzzer, LED indicators)

Project Structure

  * /LabVIEW – Contains LabVIEW VI files (main program, subVIs)

  * /Documentation – User manual, system block diagrams

  * /Schematics – Sensor wiring diagrams

Getting Started

  :- Install LabVIEW.

  :- Connect your sensors as per the schematic.

  :- Open the main VI file and run the program.

  :- Observe the real-time data and test alarm triggering under safe conditions.
